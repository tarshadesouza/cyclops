# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-13)

**Core value:** When a CI job fails, CyclOps tells you exactly why and either fixes it automatically or hands you a one-click remediation — eliminating the manual log-reading cycle that wastes engineering time across the organization.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — GitHub App Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (GitHub App Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-13 — Roadmap created (5 phases, 60 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: TypeScript monorepo (Turborepo + pnpm), Fastify, BullMQ + Redis, PostgreSQL + Prisma, Vercel AI SDK
- [Init]: No dashboard in MVP — all user output via GitHub (PR comments, check runs) and Slack
- [Init]: Split-process architecture — `apps/api` (webhook receiver) and `apps/worker` (BullMQ pipeline) are separate Railway services
- [Init]: `packages/core` must be I/O-free — no Octokit, Redis, or Prisma; required for SDK publishability
- [Init]: Permission scope locked before Phase 1 ships — `checks:write`, `contents:write`, `pull_requests:write`, `issues:write`, `actions:write`, `metadata:read`

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: PgBouncer deployment model undecided — Railway managed Postgres does not include PgBouncer; decide sidecar vs Supabase vs external before Phase 1 data model work
- [Research]: LLM provider default and BYOK model undecided — platform default key with token caps vs. every installation provides own key
- [Research]: Confidence threshold starting values (0.7 for PR comment, 0.9 for fix PR) need empirical calibration in Phase 2
